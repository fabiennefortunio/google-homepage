My first Odin's Proyect. GOOGLE HOME PAGE

this project is composed of two files plus a README

- index.html ( html code )
- style.css ( style code )

Self reflection: This project is not made exactly like the Google page but contains the most important parts. With this project i start learning basic HTML + CSS -
Being aware that this is just the beginning of my career i will keep practicing to improve on the frontend while moving forward to the next step JS!
